          <h5 class="card-header ml-3 mt-5">
            Why a Bill of Sale is Important?
          </h5>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h6>A <span>Bill of Sale</span> states that a vehicle (or other item) has been sold. This is a useful document when you're buying or selling a car privately, when there isn't as much of a paper trail as there is at a dealership. A Bill of Sale is one more way of verifying a sale has taken place, and in some cases this may be useful in proving you are no longer liable for the vehicle.</h6>
          </div>
          <h5 class="card-header ml-3 mt-2">
            Who Needs a Bill of Sale?
          </h5>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h6>For the most part, the seller just needs a <span>Bill of Sale</span> for his own records, but on the other side of the equation, the buyer might need the form in order to complete the title transfer and register the vehicle. If you show up to the DMV or your local vehicle registration branch without a Bill of Sale, the attendant might turn you away until you can show the proper paperwork with the car’s purchase price.</h6>
            <h6>Another important reason why a <span>Bill of Sale</span> is so necessary during title transfers is because some motor vehicle agencies use this document to calculate the vehicle’s license fee.</h6>
            <h6>Your <span>Bill of Sale</span> will generally include information about the transaction, including:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A description of the vehicle and its vehicle identification number (VIN).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any warranty that may have been agreed upon (or mentioned sold as is)
                </li>
                <li>
                  The final sale price of the vehicle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The name of the buyer and the seller.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The county and state in which the vehicle was sold.
                </li>
                <li>

            Bill of Sale vs. Title Transfer
          </h5>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h6>
              While a <span>Bill of Sale</span> is an essential part of the sale process, it generally does not prove ownership; only a title transfer proves ownership of a vehicle. In order to fully complete the sale, remember to transfer your title right away.
